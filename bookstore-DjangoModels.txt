Does the application have to manage any other information,

apart from books, customers, and sales? Your answer here will tell you which apps you need and,
correspondingly, which tables youâ€™ll need in your database.

What attributes are needed for each information category? 
For example, the customers category may need a name and picture for each customer.

How do these attributes (i.e., tables or apps) interact with each other?
